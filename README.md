## Overview

<a href="#">Hazel for macOS</a> is aimed at people who want their file system to maintain itself. By attaching rules to folders, users can have files automatically renamed, moved, tagged or deleted based on criteria like names, dates, types or contents. Downloads folders can clean themselves, archives can be filed where they belong and old clutter can be removed without manual sorting. This transforms routine housekeeping into background automation that quietly keeps storage under control.

Rules in Hazel are built through a friendly interface that still supports advanced combinations of conditions and actions. Scripts and <a href="#">Automator-style hooks</a> can extend behaviour into more complex workflows, integrating with other tools for compression, conversion or syncing. Notifications and logs help users understand what has happened, building confidence in the automations. Once tuned, rules can run for months or years with little adjustment, adapting to evolving workflows.

On macOS, Hazel runs as a background preference pane, staying out of the way while watching designated folders. It works smoothly with Finder tags, Trash behaviours and mounted volumes. Over time, it becomes an invisible assistant that keeps projects, downloads and archives in order with minimal effort.
